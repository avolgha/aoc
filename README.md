# Advent of Code

this project contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code project](https://adventofcode.com).

## Structure

In the root directory, we have a folders that each represent one year.  
In these folders, there are again folders for each day of the event.

The "day-folders" should contain three files:

1. input.txt
2. script.mjs
3. explanation.mjs

`input.txt` will contain the input parameters given by Advent of Code.  
`script.mjs` will contain the actual solution code for the day with both answers.  
`explanation.mjs` will contain the solution code with added comments that explain what I am doing in each step.
I put this in another file because I want the real code to be readable and not packed up with comments.
